          <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo</h2>
          <p>
            Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro born 5 February 1985 is a
            Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie
            A club Juventus and captains the Portugal national team. Often
            considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one
            of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon
            d'Or awards and four European Golden Shoes, both of which
            are records for a European player. He has won 31 major trophies in
            his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions
            Leagues, one UEFA European Championship, and one UEFA Nations League
            title. Ronaldo holds the records for the most goals (134) and
            assists (40) in the history of the UEFA Champions League. He is
            one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,000 professional
            career appearances and has scored over 770 official senior career
            goals for club and country. He is also the second male to score
            100 international goals and the first European one to achieve the
            feat.
